  ffmpeg (must be on path/aliased)


Abstract: 

Alpha build of a physics engine and simulator designed for precise situations and modeling concepts of physics ONLY using the 4 classical forces.
This engine will not have collisions or any other (useful for game engine) features. The purpose is to show how all of classical physics 
boils down to these forces, and all other equations are simply results of them (ish). The project is almost completely hand rolled with the exception of 
ffmpeg.

Current build is pretty unuseful, but you are welcome to build from source. CLI tool can be compiled with java, and Animation Library / Physics Engine
are both simple cmake builds.

First simulation produced is shown in "output.mp4".
This simulation shows an object falling towards earth.
